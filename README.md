# ```Stop-Watch```
```Use a virtual stop watch created with Svelte.js```

A simple stop watch application, created using Svelte.js, can be a useful tool for keeping track of time during various tasks or activities. Designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, the project serves as a basic example of how to combine Svelte.js and Bulma CSS to create a meaningful and functional application.
